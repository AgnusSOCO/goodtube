# GoodTube
Hello and welcome to GoodTube, a free adblocker for Youtube.<br>
This uses an alternative method to remove ads, which means it will still work even when traditional adblockers aren't working.

It also gives you an option to completely remove all shorts (this is turned on by default).

## How to install
1. Install Tampermonkey (or any other userscript manager you like):<br>
https://www.tampermonkey.net/

2. For all browsers except Firefox - click the extensions icon up the top of your browser (the little puzzle piece icon), click "manage extensions", then on the screen that opens up the top you will find an option called "developer mode". You need to turn this on.

3. For all browsers except Firefox - click the extensions icon up the top of your browser (the little puzzle piece icon), click "manage extensions", click "Details" next to the "Tampermonkey" extension, enable the "Allow user scripts" option.

3. Visit this link and press install on the page that opens up:<br>
https://github.com/goodtube4u/goodtube/raw/refs/heads/main/goodtube.user.js

4. Restart your browser.

5. Turn off any other adblockers you're using, refresh, you should be good to go. You can leave your adlockers on for other websites, they just need to be turned off for Youtube.

This sounds more confusing than it is. If you're not technical YOU CAN DO IT. Just follow the steps as they're written. In a few minutes, you'll have it working :)


## FAQs
**Do I need to manually update this?**<br>
Nope, updates are pushed to you automatically so you don't have to do anything to use the latest version.

**Playlists skip to the next video every few seconds**<br>
This is usually caused by another adblocker, userscript or extension you have installed. To fix this problem, disable all of your other adblockers, extensions and userscripts. Leave only Tampermonkey and this userscript enabled. Then refresh Youtube and check if the problem is fixed. If it's now working, turn on your other extensions and userscripts one by one until you find the one causing the issue.

**I can't watch a specific video**<br>
This will work for 99% of videos. However it won't work for videos which are age restricted or have embedding disabled. You'll see a message come up if this happens. If you want to watch one of these, you'll have to disable this for a second. Sorry all, but there's no way around it currently with this alternative method of adblocking.

**I can't use the miniplayer**<br>
The Youtube miniplayer is not supported. Instead this uses "Picture in Picture" mode, which works in most browsers / is the new standard for the web. Unfortunately Firefox does not support the Picture in Picture API, so the button is removed in Firefox until they decide to include this feature.

**I'm having a different problem**<br>
If you're having a different issue, most of the time you will find it's caused by a conflicting extension you have installed. The first thing to do is turn off literally every single other extension and userscript you have installed. Refresh Youtube, check if the problem is fixed. If it is, then you know something is conflicting. Turn your other extensions and userscripts back on one at a time until you find the cause. Please be sure to follow these steps before reporting an issue! As mentioned, it's almost always the root cause.


## Why is removing these ads so important?
Youtube remains the _largest online archive of music and art in the world_ and without it a huge amount of timeless human content and history would be lost forever. It contains extremely important digitised versions of rare physical media such as records, films, etc - which can be accessed nowhere else.<br>

Youtube is also how most people on earth access free music, art, educational videos, entertainment, etc. The importance of allowing people to access these things cannot be overstated.<br>

This content is for _everyone_ and is not Youtube's to sell back to us. We must keep this content preserved for future generations and what's been happening lately is disgraceful.<br>

I see Youtube in the same capacity as a library or museam and as such hold them to the same standards. They have a social repsonsibility which is not being taken seriously. Many disadvantaged people cannot "just buy premium". A large portion of the world lives in extreme poverty (just as one example). Many people have mental health conditions which are simply not conducive to "buying premium". These are just a few examples.<br>

This timeless human content belongs to everyone, not just the wealthy and privileged. It should not be disrespected with more and more commercial ads in this way.<br>

As a human being on this earth, with a heart, soul, mind and spirit - _you matter and are important_, despite these crazy times in which we live. _You are NOT simply a product to be bought and sold_ by capitalist companies such as Youtube.<br>

So in short - let's keep this important resource, everything on it and ourselves free.
